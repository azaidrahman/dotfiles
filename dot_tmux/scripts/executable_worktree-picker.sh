# prefix+e's worktree picker: choose which of the repo's git worktrees to review,
# then open `tuicr -w` there. Reached from claude-diff-review.sh when the repo has
# more than one worktree — see
# docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-30-prefix-e-worktree-picker-design.md.
#
# Worktrees only. This deliberately does NOT browse directories or filenames the
# way the dir-picker it replaced did; if you want a different directory, cd there
# and press prefix+e again.
#
# Rows are `<marker><branch>\t<short path>\t<abs path>`. fzf shows fields 1-2
# (--with-nth) and prints the whole selected row, which `cut -f3` then reduces
# to the absolute path — so it never has to be parsed back out of the display
# text, and paths with spaces survive intact. (Not --accept-nth: that needs
# fzf >= 0.62, and this box's fzf predates it.)
# The current worktree sorts first and is marked ●, so prefix+e then Enter still
# reviews where you are: the old muscle memory, one keystroke longer.
#
# $1 — pane id, for the conditional `cd` on accept. Or `--list` to print the raw
#      rows and exit (test seam: fzf needs a tty, row rendering does not).
